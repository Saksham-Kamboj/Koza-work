Adults belonging to any age group can suffer from it because of various external or internal factors.</div><br><div>Acne is not a life-threatening condition, but it does come in way of people’s personal aesthetic satisfaction.

            answer: `<div>You think active acne is one of the most irritating dermatological conditions you could suffer through, until you're forced to deal with acne scars. We're not talking about the little dark or red marks that go away with time, exfoliation, and scar facing spot treatments. Instead, we're talking about atrophic scarring—aka indented scars that form below the upper layer of skin tissue as a result of severe acne that prevents the skin from being able to regenerate tissue correctly, leaving behind uneven texture in shapes known as ice-pick, rolling, and boxcar scars.</div><br><div>Acne like cysts or nodules which are considered to be “inflammatory acne”, lead to long-term scarring because they penetrate beneath the upper layer of the skin. </div><br> <div>Some individuals are more prone to acne scars compared to others because of picking/touching, ignoring acne treatment and also because of genetics. Our clinic is known to provide outstanding services regarding acne scar treatment in Gurgaon. The highly experienced dermatologists in our clinic do their best to diagnose and treat such blemishes.</div>`,

            answer: '<div>There are two main types of acne scars:</div><br><li>Depressed Acne Scars– These scars are deep-pitted are the most common kind of acne scars. They are caused by inflammatory acne. </li><br><p>Depressed scars can be further classified into the following three types:</p><br><li>Rolling Scars– They are broadened pits on the skin which have rounded edges. The texture is rough and is caused by severe damage beneath the surface of the skin. </li><br><li>Boxcar Scars– These are similar to rolling scars in terms of the depth of the depression but they are more defined and have strong edges. </li><br><li>Ice Pick Scars– These scars are not broad. They appear like tiny dot-like depressions, a little bigger than the size of our hair follicles, but covering it up is the most challenging task for dermatologists.</li><br><li>Raised Acne Scars– These scars are not as prevalent as depressed scars. They are much more prominent compared to depressed scars and require a tough treatment procedure. It usually looks like a small/big bump.</li><br><p>Raised Acne Scars– These scars are not as prevalent as depressed scars.

Collagen seems to build around the acne scar, making it grow in size.</li><li>Hypertrophic Scars– This is also caused in the presence of excess collagen, but its intensity is less severe than that of Keloid Scars. They are not as prominent as Keloids. It appears reddish in colour.</li>',
