This practise is harmful, as the facial skin is very delicate and wrong product and wrong amount of pressure can damage the skin which may lead to redness, acne and rashes. The best alternative for the above is MDA. It can be done every 15-20 days for oily skin and monthly for sensitive skin to keep it clean and glowing in its natural form.</div>',
