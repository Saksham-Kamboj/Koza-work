                        While there are various products and shampoos in the
                        market which claim to cure dandruff, these products may
                        or may not work for every individual. These products
                        contain generic ingredients which may not be suitable
                        for someone's specific condition. It may even adversely
                        affect a person, leading to hair fall or making the hair
                        dry and frizzy. It is recommended to use a dermatologist
                        prescribed shampoo only. Appropriate shampoo according
                        to the scalp type is prescribed by our experts to keep
                        dandruff problems under check.
