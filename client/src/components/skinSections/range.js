                        A chemical peel is a cosmetic dermatological procedure
                        that uses specially formulated chemical solutions to
                        improve the texture and appearance of your skin. During
                        a chemical peel, the top layer of your skin is
                        exfoliated, encouraging the growth of new, healthier
                        skin cells. This treatment is highly effective in
                        addressing a variety of skin concerns, such as fine
                        lines, acne scars, age spots, and uneven skin tone.
