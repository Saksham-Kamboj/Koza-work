      question: "What Causes Pigmentation?",
      answer:
        "<div>Melanin in our bodies gives our skin its color. Depending on the amount of melanin that is created within you, your skin tone will differ from light to dark normally. Specific cells in the skin called melanocytes make melanin and when these cells are unhealthy or damaged it affects the production process of melanin in our bodies. Either too much or too little melanin will cause skin pigmentation disorders making the skin look lighter, darker, blotchy or discoloured. While some pigmentation disorders affect only small patches of skin others can spread over to the entire body. Some of the causes include </div> <br> <li>Genetics </li><br> <li>Suns exposure – to protect your skin from the sun’s harmful UV rays, the body produces more melanin. Therefore, when being exposed to the sun too much dark spots can occur. </li><br> <li>Suns exposure – to protect your skin from the sun’s harmful UV rays, the body produces more melanin.

      question: "What is the cost of pigmentation treatment?",

        "If you follow homemade, do it yourself remedies for your pigmentation to reduce it will not cost you anything. However, most of the time these are ineffective to tackle serious cases of hyperpigmentation or other. Therefore, medical assistance from a clinic is better sought. The cost of the treatment will depend on numerous factors such as the type of skin condition and the suitable treatment procedure. For example, laser treatment could be a little bit pricey per session it is highly effective and guarantees that the darkened spots will not return.
