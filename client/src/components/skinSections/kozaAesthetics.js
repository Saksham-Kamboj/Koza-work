                                Skin experts at Koza AESTHETICS can help you identify the cause of your hyperpigmentation and work with you to develop an appropriate treatment plan.

                                No matter what treatment you ultimately choose, it’s important to protect your skin from further sun damage and hyperpigmentation. Wearing sunscreen every day is a must. 
                                You should apply sunscreen every morning — even when it’s cloudy! — and reapply as needed throughout the day. Be sure to use a sunscreen with SPF 30 or higher.
