            <div>Gynecomastia surgery, or male breast reduction, is a cosmetic procedure designed to treat enlarged or swollen breast tissue in men. During the surgery, excess breast tissue and fat are removed, and the chest is reshaped to create a more masculine and flatter appearance. This procedure helps individuals with gynecomastia regain their self-confidence and alleviate any emotional distress caused by feminine chest characteristics. It is typically performed on healthy individuals who have stabilized their weight and addressed any underlying hormonal issues. Gynecomastia surgery can provide long-lasting results, enhancing both physical appearance and emotional well-being.</div>`,
