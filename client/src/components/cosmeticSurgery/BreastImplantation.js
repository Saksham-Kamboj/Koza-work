        "Breast implantation is a surgical procedure that involves placing special silicone or saline-filled bags, called implants, inside a person's breasts. These implants are used to make the breasts larger, fuller, or more shapely. It's like adding padding or filling to change the size and shape of the breasts. People choose breast implantation for various reasons, such as to enhance their appearance or to restore breast volume lost due to factors like pregnancy, weight loss or aging.",
