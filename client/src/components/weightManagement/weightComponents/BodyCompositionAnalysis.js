      including crucial details such as body fat percentage, muscle mass, bone density, and water content.`,
        `By analysing your body composition through parameters like BMI, BMR, fat%, lean%, age, gender, you can understand why you weigh what you weigh.`,
        `By delving into these specifics, we gain valuable insights into your unique physiology and
      can tailor a weight loss program that precisely addresses your needs and goals.`,
        `Two people of same sex and body weight may look completely different from each other because they have a different body composition.`,
        `This data-driven approach ensures that your weight loss journey is both effective and safe, leading to lasting results and improved overall health.`,
